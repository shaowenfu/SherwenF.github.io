    - **Overview:**
        
                 We investigated the optimization design problem of the key component in tower solar thermal power plants - the sundial field, to meet the requirements of new energy power systems and achieve carbon neutrality goals. The sundial field consists of sundials and absorption towers, focusing sunlight onto absorption towers in real-time to generate thermal energy. This paper highlights the innovative points and key algorithms for each problem:
        
        1. **Optical Efficiency Calculation for Single Sundial:**
        Under specific conditions, we employed a physical model and optical principles to calculate the key efficiency parameters of a single sundial, including shadow efficiency and truncation efficiency. Particularly, we used ray tracing and Monte Carlo algorithms to address complex shadowing and obstruction scenarios, establishing a universal solving model. Additionally, we utilized octree algorithms to accelerate optical efficiency calculations, ensuring efficient performance analysis. Finally, based on the calculated optical efficiency, we derived the annual average output thermal power and unit mirror area's annual average output thermal power.
        2. **Multi-Variable Optimization for Sundial Field Design:**
        Problem two framed the sundial field design as a multi-variable optimization problem, aiming to find the optimal installation scheme for sundials and the positions of absorption towers to maximize the unit mirror area's annual average output power. We introduced heuristic algorithms (such as genetic algorithms or differential evolution algorithms) to search for the best combinations of decision variables to achieve maximized output power per unit mirror area. This innovative approach comprehensively considers factors such as absorption tower position, sundial size, and installation height to achieve optimal performance.
        3. **Enhanced Optimization with Variable Sundial Sizes and Heights:**
        Problem three further increased the optimization freedom by allowing different sizes and installation heights for each sundial. We redesigned the optimization model from problem two, focusing on determining the optimal size and height for each sundial to maximize the unit mirror area's annual average output thermal power while ensuring compliance with rated power requirements. This increased flexibility provides adaptability to varying energy demands under different conditions.
        
        In summary, this paper highlights the innovative approach of using optical efficiency models and complex algorithms to solve the sundial field design problem. By fully considering various factors such as optical characteristics, layout, and power requirements, this research provides important theoretical foundations and practical guidance for the development of clean energy. These research findings are expected to drive the performance optimization of solar thermal power plants and contribute to the widespread application of sustainable energy.

    ### **Problem Analysis:**
    
    ### 1.  Analysis of Problem One:
    
    - Problem one aims to study the performance parameters of a sundial field under specific conditions, including annual average optical efficiency, annual average output thermal power, and unit mirror area's annual average output thermal power. The challenges of this problem mainly focus on two aspects:
        1. **Abstraction of a Universal Physical Model for Single Mirror Optical Geometry:**
        The primary task is to establish a universal physical model that accurately describes the optical characteristics of a single sundial, including shadow efficiency, cosine efficiency, atmospheric transmittance, truncation efficiency, and mirror reflectivity. Among these, shadow efficiency and truncation efficiency are the core focus.
        2. **Calculation of Performance Parameters for the Entire Sundial Field:**
        Building upon the model for a single mirror, we need to consider how to comprehensively evaluate the efficiency parameters of all mirrors to calculate the annual average optical efficiency, annual average output thermal power, and unit mirror area's annual average output thermal power for the entire field. To address these challenges, we employ the following methods: firstly, we focus on individual sundials, establishing a geometric model and utilizing optical principles to calculate five key efficiency parameters. We particularly focus on calculating shadow efficiency and truncation efficiency, which are the focal points of our study. By combining ray tracing and Monte Carlo algorithms, we study various ray vectors' shadowing and obstruction scenarios under different conditions and the truncation of rays by collectors. We establish a universal solving model capable of calculating a single mirror's optical efficiency at any given time. Next, we employ octree algorithms to expedite the search for other mirrors that may cast shadows or obstruct the target mirror. This step significantly accelerates the calculation of a single mirror's optical efficiency. Finally, by nested looping through all sundial coordinates provided, we can determine the annual average optical efficiency of the entire field.
        
    
    In summary, the calculation of annual average output thermal power and unit mirror area's annual average output thermal power is based on optical efficiency. Therefore, we first focus on studying the optical properties of a single mirror and then use efficient algorithms to calculate the field's performance parameters.
    
    ### 2.  Analysis of Problem Two:
    
    - Problem two is a typical optimization problem aimed at finding the optimal installation scheme for sundials and the positions of absorption towers to maximize the unit mirror area's annual average output power. This problem involves a series of decision variables, including absorption tower coordinates, sundial size and coordinates, and sundial height characteristics. The complexity lies in needing to solve the objective function expression and considering various constraints to ensure that the obtained optimization solution is feasible in practical applications. To solve problem two, we need to establish an optimization model, where maximizing the unit mirror area's annual average output power is the optimization objective. Specifically, we can consider the following factors:
        1. **Absorption Tower Position Coordinates:**
        The position of absorption towers is crucial for the system's performance. By adjusting the absorption tower's coordinates, we can maximize the incident sunlight on the mirrors, thereby increasing energy collection.
        2. **Sundial Size and Coordinates:**
        The size and position of sundials also significantly impact the system's performance. Proper adjustment of sundial size and position ensures effective focusing of sunlight, enhancing optical energy utilization efficiency.
        3. **Sundial Height:**
        Sundial installation height affects shadowing effects and obstruction scenarios. By setting the sundial's height appropriately, we can reduce the likelihood of shadows or obstructions, thus improving optical efficiency. To establish this optimization model, we need to consider various constraints, such as the distance between sundials and not exceeding a specified area. These constraints limit the feasible range of decision variables, ensuring that the obtained optimization solution is practically viable. Finally, through heuristic optimization algorithms such as genetic algorithms or differential evolution algorithms, we can search for the best combinations of decision variables to maximize the unit mirror area's annual average output power. This optimization method allows us to find the best solution in a complex multivariable environment to meet the problem's requirements. In conclusion, problem two involves professional knowledge in optics and engineering, requiring comprehensive consideration of various factors to establish a suitable optimization model to achieve the goal of maximizing energy output.
        
    
    ### 3.  Analysis of Problem Three:
    
    - Problem three aims to find the optimal layout of the sundial field by adjusting the size and installation height of sundials to maximize the unit mirror area's annual average output thermal power while ensuring the rated power is reached. Unlike problem two, problem three allows different sizes and installation heights for each sundial, increasing the problem's complexity. In problem three, we need to modify the optimization model from problem two to accommodate the new situation. The optimization model needs to consider the following factors:
        1. **Sizes of Each Sundial:**
        Allowing different sizes for each sundial means that each sundial's focusing efficiency and optical characteristics may differ. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the optimal size for each sundial to maximize energy collection efficiency.
        2. **Installation Heights of Each Sundial:**
        Installation heights of sundials can also differ, affecting shadowing effects and obstruction scenarios. Proper adjustment of installation heights can reduce the likelihood of shadows or obstructions, thereby improving optical efficiency.
        3. **Sundial Field Layout:**
        Problem three requires finding the optimal layout of the sundial field, which involves determining the coordinates of each sundial. By optimizing the sundial's positions, we can further enhance optical efficiency and energy output.
        4. **Constraints to Achieve Rated Power:**
        Similar to problem two, problem three also needs to satisfy constraints to achieve rated power. This means that the optimization model must ensure that the obtained layout not only maximizes output power but also meets power requirements.
        
    
    To solve problem three, we need to readjust the optimization model from problem two, introducing the sizes and installation heights of each sundial and redefining decision variables. Subsequently, through numerical optimization algorithms such as genetic algorithms or differential evolution algorithms, we search for the best layout and parameter combinations to maximize energy output. This problem involves more degrees of freedom and complexity, requiring comprehensive consideration of multiple factors, including sundial optical properties, layout, and power requirements. In practical applications, solving problem three will provide more flexible choices for sundial field design and layout to meet energy demands under different conditions. Therefore, problem three has significant application prospects in optics and engineering fields.
